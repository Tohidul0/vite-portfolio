                    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and SQL, allowing me to build and maintain modern web applications. With a
                    strong foundation in programming, I am proficient in C and C++, and I've honed my problem-solving skills
                    through tackling over 250 complex challenges. Additionally, my knowledge extends to object-oriented
                    programming (OOP) principles and a deep understanding of data structures and algorithms. I am enthusiastic
                    about applying this comprehensive skill set to create engaging and functional websites while continually
